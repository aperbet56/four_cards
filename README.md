# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- SASS
- Animation CSS: hover effect on card
- Page responsive
